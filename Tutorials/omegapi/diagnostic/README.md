- Diagnostic histograms as generated by gen_amp and gen_omegapi for the b1(1235) using omegapi_AmpPol amplitude. In this sumulation all production amplitudes (i.e. vertices) were set to 1.0 and all decay amplitudes were set to 0.0 except for one decay amplitude noted in the file name as "*_c_Spin_Parity_Orbital-Quantum-Number".
- "b1" is simulated with S and D waves decay amplitudes for isovector state with a D/S ratio of 0.27.
- "all" means that all decay amplitudes are set to 1.0.
